***language model training***

the obejective of this repo is to use transformer and tokenizer for language model training.

the language data we use is esperanto, which is invented as an artificial language in the last centry, that claimed to be merging characteristics of different languages from the world, and 'getting the best of (so many) worlds'.

to get the training data, use the following command in your terminal:

```
wget -c https://cdn-datasets.huggingface.co/EsperBERTo/data/oscar.eo.txt
